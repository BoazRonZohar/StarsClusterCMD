Cluster CMD Creator

A complete photometry pipeline for star clusters (open or globular).

Interactive user input (cluster type, distance, extinction parameters, FITS files).

Background subtraction and source detection in B and V bands.

Aperture photometry with per–star radius based on FWHM.

Cross–matching between B and V detections.

Extraction of calibration stars from the APASS catalog and magnitude calibration.

Galactic extinction correction (A_V, E(B–V)).

Cluster membership filtering (Gaia membership for open clusters, radial cut for globulars).

Outputs calibrated photometry tables for all stars and cluster members.

Generates color–magnitude diagrams (CMD) and annotated FITS images.
